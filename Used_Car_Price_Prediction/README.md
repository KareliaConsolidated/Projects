### Description
<pre>
A Machine Learning Model which is able to predict the price of used car. 

Before training our model, our main focus was cleaning and preprocessing of input data points.

As this is a Regression Problem, I have used different regressor algorithms to train model.
For Model Evaluation, I have used evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Percentage Error and R2-Score.

We get a score of above 99% on train set and 92% on validation set.
